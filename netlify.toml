[build]

The directory containing your static assets. We use "." because index.html,

client/, and admin/ are in the project root.

publish = "."

The directory where Netlify will find your functions

functions = "netlify/functions"
command = "npm install"

This maps all requests starting with /api/ to the Netlify function handler.

from = "/api/*"
to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
status = 200

This redirects all other root requests to the static index.html file,

allowing client-side routing for your dashboard.

from = "/"
to = "/index.html"
status = 200
